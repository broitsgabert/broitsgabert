**Current status**  
Trying to fix bugs and creating new ones, it's becoming a full-time job.

**Things I sometimes touch**
- Code (when it's not touching back)
- Bugs (intentional, obviously)
- Keyboard (gently, itâ€™s been through enough)
- Grass (jk)

**Most commits**
- Confessionals to future me
- Bug fixes that fix nothing
- Comments like `// idk`

**Profile pic**
Yes, thatâ€™s Moses. No, I wonâ€™t explain.

If you made it this far... you're probably lost too.
